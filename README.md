##Ai_agent##
This repository, Ai_agent, provides a foundational structure for developing and experimenting with AI agents. It's designed to be a flexible starting point for those looking to build, test, and refine AI agent functionalities.

Features
Modular Design: Easily integrate different components for various agent functionalities (e.g., perception, decision-making, action execution).
Extensible: Add new agent behaviors and capabilities without overhauling the core structure.
Configurable: Adjust agent parameters and settings for different use cases and environments.
Example Implementations: Includes basic examples to help you get started with common agent patterns.
Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/nilsenpai/Ai_agent.git
cd Ai_agent
Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: A requirements.txt file is assumed. If one doesn't exist, you'll need to create it based on your project's dependencies or install them individually.)

Usage
Once installed, you can start experimenting with the AI agent.

Running an Example Agent
To run a basic agent example:

Bash

python main.py
(Note: This assumes a main.py file exists that serves as the entry point for running an agent. Adjust the command if your project uses a different entry point.)

Refer to the examples directory (if present) for specific usage patterns and how to implement your own agents.
